- title: What's Happening in 2023
  description: 'A lot of technology has come and gone in the past year, things like
    Web3 made a quick impact, but stalled a bit in terms of implementation.


    Generative AI through tools like Dall-E, ChatGPT and Open AI, Hugging Face are
    the current trend, but what should people in technology know to prepare for this
    next year?


    I can''t think of two people who can answer that question better than two of our
    own Content Managers Natalie Pao and Simon St. Laurent. Their job is to keep their
    fingers of the pulse of the industry and hire people who are going to create the
    future of Technology.'
